We propose an end-to-end pipeline for data-driven decision making in which constraints and objectives are directly learned from data using machine learning, and the trained models are embedded in an optimization formulation. We exploit the mixed-integer optimization-representability of many machine learning methods, including linear models, decision trees, ensembles, and multi-layer perceptrons. The consideration of multiple methods allows us to capture various underlying relationships between decisions, contextual features, and outcomes. We also characterize the feasible decision space, or ''trust region,'' using the convex hull of the observations, to ensure credible recommendations and avoid extrapolation. We efficiently incorporate this representation using column generation and clustering. In combination with domain-driven constraints and objectives, the embedded models and trust region define a mixed-integer optimization problem for prescription generation. We implement this framework as a Python package (OptiCL) for practitioners. We demonstrate the method in both chemotherapy optimization and World Food Programme planning. The case studies illustrate the benefit of the framework in generating high-quality prescriptions, and the value added by the trust region, the incorporation of multiple machine learning methods, and the inclusion of multiple learned constraints.","tags":null,"title":"Mixed-integer optimization with constraint learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dimitris Bertsimas","Holly Wiberg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1633683600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633683600,"objectID":"86b726ff17e425b861f5d26bc1a04e13","permalink":"https://hwiberg.github.io/talk/cornell_yrw/","publishdate":"2021-10-08T09:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/cornell_yrw/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Optimization with Constraint Learning","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Dimitris Bertsimas","Holly Wiberg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1626876000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1626876000,"objectID":"485a145ed32e307979e5e8e24e9da9f5","permalink":"https://hwiberg.github.io/talk/informshealthcare2021/","publishdate":"2021-07-21T14:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/informshealthcare2021/","section":"talk","summary":"Personalized treatment involves several complex decisions, particularly in the presence of multiple treatment options and continuous dosages.

We seek to develop a machine learning-based neutropenia prediction model that can be used to assess risk at the initiation of a chemotherapy cycle. **Materials and Methods:** We leverage rich Electronic Medical Records data from a large healthcare system and apply machine learning methods to predict severe and febrile neutropenic events. We outline the data curation process and challenges posed by Electronic Medical Records data. We explore a range of algorithms with an emphasis on model interpretability and ease-of-use in a clinical setting. **Results:** Our final proposed model demonstrates an out-of-sample AUC of 0.865 (95% CI 0.830-0.891) in the prediction of neutropenic events based on only 20 clinical features. The model validates known risk factors and offers insight into potential novel clinical indicators and treatment characteristics that elevate risk. It relies on factors that are directly extractable from Electronic Medical Records, providing a tool can be easily integrated into existing workflows.

Several groups have focused on the potential treatment utility of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) for hypertensive COVID-19 patients, with inconclusive evidence thus far. We couple electronic medical record (EMR) and registry data of 3,643 patients from Spain, Italy, Germany, Ecuador, and the US with a machine learning framework to personalize the prescription of ACEIs and ARBs to hypertensive COVID-19 patients. Our approach leverages clinical and demographic information to identify hospitalized individuals whose probability of mortality or morbidity can decrease by prescribing this class of drugs. In particular, the algorithm proposes increasing ACEI/ARBs prescriptions for patients with cardiovascular disease and decreasing prescriptions for those with low oxygen saturation at admission. We show that personalized recommendations can improve patient outcomes by 1.0% compared to the standard of care when applied to external populations. We develop an interactive interface for our algorithm, providing physicians with an actionable tool to easily assess treatment alternatives and inform clinical decisions.

Specifically, we propose a comprehensive data-driven approach to understand the clinical characteristics of COVID-19, predict its mortality, forecast its evolution, and ultimately alleviate its impact. By leveraging cohort-level clinical data, patient-level hospital data, and census-level epidemiological data, we develop an integrated four-step approach, combining descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics. First, we aggregate hundreds of clinical studies into the most comprehensive database on COVID-19 to paint a new macroscopic picture of the disease. Second, we build personalized calculators to predict the risk of infection and mortality as a function of demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, and lab values. Third, we develop a novel epidemiological model to project the pandemic's spread and inform social distancing policies. Fourth, we propose an optimization model to reallocate ventilators and alleviate shortages. Our results have been used at the clinical level by several hospitals to triage patients, guide care management, plan ICU capacity, and re-distribute ventilators.

This study seeks to develop and validate a data-driven personalized mortality risk calculator for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. \n **Methods:** De-identified data was obtained for 3,927 COVID-19 positive patients from six independent centers, comprising 33 different hospitals. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables were collected at hospital admission. The COVID-19 Mortality Risk (CMR) tool was developed using the XGBoost algorithm to predict mortality. Its discrimination performance was subsequently evaluated on three validation cohorts. \n **Findings:** The derivation cohort of 3,062 patients has an observed mortality rate of 26.84%. Increased age, decreased oxygen saturation (≤ 93%), elevated levels of C-reactive protein (≥ 130 mg/L), blood urea nitrogen (≥ 18 mg/dL), and blood creatinine (≥ 1.2 mg/dL) were identified as primary risk factors, validating clinical findings. The model obtains out-of-sample AUCs of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87-0.94) on the derivation cohort. In the validation cohorts, the model obtains AUCs of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88-0.95) on Seville patients, 0.87 (95% CI, 0.84-0.91) on Hellenic COVID-19 Study Group patients, and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76-0.85) on Hartford Hospital patients. The CMR tool is available as an online application at covidanalytics.io/mortality_calculator and is currently in clinical use. \n **Interpretation:** The CMR model leverages machine learning to generate accurate mortality predictions using commonly available clinical features.
